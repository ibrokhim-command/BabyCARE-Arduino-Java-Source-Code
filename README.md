## Blockchain-based Distributed Supercomputing Platform
  CONUN is a platform that builds a horizontal distributed desktop computing   system integrated with blockchain technology that shares idle processing resources on personal computers to handle multiple projects that require high performance computing resources. CONUN uses Ethereum blockchain that transparently and securely exchanges transactions , agreements, and payments without any intermediary services.

"CONUN offers an efficient environment for computational speedup, expandability , availability , reliability, and above all, good price-performance benefits"
